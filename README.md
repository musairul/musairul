## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
In this github, you will mostly see my projects from learning web development for fun through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

If any links to projects dont work, its likely because I use free tiers of hosting providers and they typically only allow 1 site at a time and sometimes they shut links down if theres no users

### Some of my projects:
- [My Blog](musairul.github.io/blog/)
